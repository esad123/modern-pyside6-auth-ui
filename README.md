A clean, professional authentication UI built using **PySide6**, designed to emulate modern web aesthetics inside a native Python desktop application.
Includes Login, Signup, Forgot Password, and Info/Policy views — all styled with custom theming, smooth interactions, and Web3-ready components.

## ✨ Features

### 🌙 Modern UI/UX

* Custom QSS theming (no outdated default Qt look)
* Beautiful card-based authentication layout
* Smooth hover states and focus animations
* Clean typography and consistent spacing

### 🔐 Hybrid Authentication (Web2 + Web3)

* **Web2 Login:** Email + Password fields
* **Reset Password Flow** with confirmation messaging
* **Signup Screen** with optional invite code behavior
* **Web3-Ready Buttons:** Google + Phantom wallet placeholders ready to connect to OAuth or wallet APIs

### 🧩 Modular Architecture

* `LoginPage` emits `login_successful(username)` for easy app integration
* Components are self-contained, making the UI plug-and-play
* Backend-agnostic — integrate with:

  * Firebase / Supabase
  * Flask / FastAPI backend
  * Web3 providers like Solana RPC, Phantom Wallet Adapter, etc.

### 🛠️ Interactive Elements

* Password visibility toggle w/ hover-recolor SVG icons
* Inline error + success messaging
* Auto-clearing error states while typing
* Responsive design inside the authentication panel

## 🧱 Tech Stack

* **Language:** Python 3.10+
* **Framework:** PySide6 (Qt for Python)
* **UI Styling:** QSS with theme constants
* **Assets:** SVG + PNG icons (Google, Phantom, Eye / HiddenEye, Logos)

## ❓ Why This Exists

PySide6 is powerful — but its default widgets look outdated for modern apps.

This template solves that by offering a **web-inspired**, modern authentication interface you can drop directly into any desktop application (AI tools, crypto dashboards, automation suites, internal company software, etc.).

Perfect for:

* Portfolios
* Startup MVPs
* Web3 tools
* Desktop clients with modern design standards

## 🔌 Connecting Your Backend

Inside `login_ui.py` you’ll find clearly marked **TODO** sections where backend integration goes:

### ✔ Login

Located in `handle_login()`
Replace the dummy check with real authentication logic. On success:

```python
self.login_successful.emit(username)
```

### ✔ Signup

Located in `handle_register()`
Connect this to your backend registration endpoint.

### ✔ Password Reset

Located in `handle_reset_password()`
Wire this to your email reset workflow or API.

Backend is intentionally excluded so you can use this in:

* commercial apps
* closed-source clients
* multi-tenant backends
